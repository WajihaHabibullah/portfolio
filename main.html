                    <h2>Good Memory</h2>
                    <p>My first step toward a career in cybersecurity began with a goal: to secure admission to one of the top universities for computer science. I spent months preparing, pouring all my energy into mastering the material and acing the admission test. But when the results came, I was devastated—I hadn’t made it. Rather than give up, I threw myself back into preparation, working harder than ever, determined to succeed. When I retook the test, my persistence paid off, and I finally received the acceptance letter. That moment was proof that resilience can open doors to the future.</p>
